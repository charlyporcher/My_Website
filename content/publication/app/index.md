title = "Evicted from the Land of Opportunity: Evidence on Displacement from California Rent Control"
abstract = "We investigate the socioeconomic impacts of plausibly exogenous eviction from rent-controlled housing in California. Under the Ellis Act, landlords are allowed to evict all tenants from a building and withdraw it from the rental market. We assemble panel data on address histories, employment, income, and neighborhood characteristics for all Ellis-evictees in San Francisco and a control group of non-evictees in the same block. We confirm that those large-building evictions appear orthogonal to evicteesâ€™ individual characteristics after controlling for observable household and neighborhood effects. Comparing those two groups with a difference-in-difference approach, we find that evicted tenants between 1998 and 2012 not only exhibit a higher propensity to exit the city but also endure a reduction in nominal income that reaches 20 percent eight years after the eviction, the end of our analysis window. Those income losses are also experienced, in the same magnitude but more gradually, by evictees who remain in San Francisco. Those large income losses contrast with the income improvement we observe for non-eviction-related relocations. The negative impact extends to their residential destinations post-eviction, which tend to be neighborhoods with lower job density, higher unemployment rates, and diminished school quality, particularly for tenants with lower pre-eviction income. Specifically, children from evicted households face significant setbacks, evidenced by diminished earnings in early adulthood, suggesting a persistent intergenerational impact."
