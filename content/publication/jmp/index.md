title = "Migration with Costly Information - Job Market Paper"
abstract = "Information is important for migration decisions. How costly is information acquisition, how do these costs depend on the economic environment, how do they affect migration decisions, and ultimately, the spatial allocation of workers? To investigate these questions, I develop a quantitative dynamic model of migration with costly information acquisition and local information sharing. Agents are rationally inattentive and migration shares feature a tractable logit structure. Information frictions affect both the magnitude and the responsiveness of migration flows to variations in local opportunities. I apply the model to internal migration in Brazil and estimate it using migration flows between 137 regions. Finding where to go appears to be as costly as moving, with annualized average costs of information and migration both equal to 3% of earnings. The model successfully predicts the observed heterogeneous migration elasticities and delayed migration responses to local shocks. To illustrate its quantitative implications, I evaluate the counterfactual effect of the roll-out of broadband internet in Brazil. By allowing workers to make better mobility choices, expanding internet access increases average welfare by 1.6%, reduces migration flows by 1.2% and reduces the cross sectional dispersion in earnings by 4%."
