title = "The Geography of Trade and International Migration: A Quantitative Analysis of the European Free Mobility Zone"

abstract = "The 2004-07 Enlargement of the European Union introduced 12 countries into the free European labor and goods markets, leading to an intensification of trade and migration flows within the European Union. How did this two-fold integration affect the welfare of new and former member countries?  To investigate this question, I develop a quantitative economic geography model with costly trade and migration. In the model, agents of different skill, in each of the 27 EU countries, make migration decisions. I use data on yearly bilateral migration and trade to estimate the decline of migration and trade costs between 2000 and 2015. I then compare the welfare of each country in 2015 to a counterfactual economy in which bilateral migration and/or trade costs would have remained at their 2000 level. The decrease in trade costs led to an average of 2.1% welfare gains among new EU members, and 0.22% gains among former members, while the decrease in migration costs induced 7.1% welfare gains on average for new members, and 0.61% gains for former members. By allowing convergence in income between new and former member countries, trade integration limited migration incentives, leading to a reduction of migration flows by 6.4%. The positive selection on skill of migrants from new member countries led to an increase in the skill premium by 5% in these countries."
# Did migration and trade contribute differently to the welfare gains, and did their effect interact?
